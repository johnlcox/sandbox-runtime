# sandbox-runtime

An implementation of a sandboxed environment for running untrusted code with limited security permissions. Additionally, it shows how custom permissions can be implemented that provided finer grained security that the standard permissions available in Java.

Credit for many of the ideas for running sandboxed code goes to Will Sargent's [Sandbox Experiment in Scala](https://github.com/wsargent/sandboxexperiment).
